    <p>Sergey is a tiny lil’ static site generator. It’s a progressive tool designed to site atop your already brilliant
      HTML. In it’s simplest form, Sergey is a combo of <strong>HTML + partials.</strong></p>
    <p>If you’ve ever had to make a change to every header on a totally static website, you’ll know how cumbersome and
      error-prone it is to copy and paste the changes through all the files. That’s where Sergey comes in. Sergey lets you
      move that header into a single, importable file, and helps you include it everywhere you need it.</p>
  
  </div>
</header>


  <main class="insulate">
    <div class="wrapper content">
      <h2>The Hello, World example</h2>
      <p counter>Our starting point is an <code>index.html</code> file.</p>

      <p>This is lovely, clean HTML. But it becomes problematic when we add a few more pages and need to update the header on
      each page.</p>

      <p counter>Let’s move the header into it’s own file: <code>_imports/header.html</code></p>

      <p counter>Then we can import it in to our original file with the
      <code>&lt;sergey-import src=“header” /&gt;</code> tag</p>

      <p counter>If you’ve already got a <code>package.json</code> file, feel free to ignore this point!</p>
      
      <p>You’ll need to have <a href="https://nodejs.org">Node.js</a> installed to use Sergey. Once that’s done, open terminal/command line and cd into your
      website directory. Then, run the following command: <code>npm init -y</code></p>

      <p counter>It’s time to install Sergey! Run the command:
      <code>npm install sergey</code></p>

      <p>Now we need to add the build and dev commands to the <code>scripts</code> section of the <code>package.json</code> file. All in all, it should
      look a bit like this:</p>

      <p counter>Wonderful! Let’s run Sergey with the command: npm run start. If it’s all gone well, you should have a new <code>public</code> folder
      in your website directory! It should include an index.html file with the original header in place of the
      <code>&lt;sergey-import /&gt;</code>.</p>
      
      <p></p>This public folder is the one to upload to your web server. If you’re deploying via Git (say to Netlify), you can add
      public/ to your .gitignore file.</p>
